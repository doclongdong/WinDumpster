The user.js file needs to go into your profile directory, which can be found by going into Explorer and then going to:


`%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\`

You then need to figure out the actual profile you're using, which you can do by typing `about:profiles` into the search bar. This should show the correct profile you are currently using.

Then place `user.js` into the corresponding directory in `Profiles`. You will know if it is the right directory because there will be a bunch of other `.js` files and other web junk in there.
